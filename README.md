# CP1404 Assignment: Songs To Learn by Raunak Dutta

While finishing up the Project, I found that careful planning was needed and keeping the end result
 in mind wasn’t always necessary while I experimented with other thing that might or might not be useful
 for the end result. I learned that there are a lot of ways to go about solving a problem and 
 experimentation with the code is the best way to degerming which ways can be the most realistic as well
 as optimal ways to solve a given problems, also dividing the larger problem into a bunch of sub problems 
 does help a lot too. All and all this project took me upwards of 4:30 which is an all-time high for me, 
 but well worth it because I learned a lot about Kivy and all it’s graphical prowess. While also learning
 somethings about threading in python though, it is redacted from my final code.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
